## OurPan
I started OurPan as a way to share recipes and keep track of the ingredients needed to actually make them without the messy websites full of advertisements throughout the internet.
### Why 
I took this opportunity to learn Flutter and Firebase, two pieces of software that I had been looking at learning for a while but didn't have an idea that fit their uses. I had fooled around in Android Studio in Java before but it never felt quite right to me. Flutter on the other hand made much more sense and the cross-platform features made it attractive to me as a solo developer.
### From Here
This is the base version and a lot of features are missing. There are `TODO`s scattered around the code that all need to be done as well as some features that are simply missing. I will continue to work on this here and there, but it is not something I will be actively maintaining.
